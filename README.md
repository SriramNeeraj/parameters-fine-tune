theoretical physics, fine-tuning is the process in which parameters of a model must be adjusted very precisely in order to fit with certain observations.precisely adjusted for the highest level of performance, efficiency, or effectiveness a fine-tuned machine His voice on "Always Late with Your Kisses" rolled along its cordillera of syllables like a fine-tuned sports car.—Technological devices are paradigmatic examples of fine-tuning. Whether they function as intended depends sensitively on parameters that describe the shape, arrangement, and material properties of their constituents, e.g., the constituents' conductivity, elasticity and thermal expansion coefficient.television: Controls. … touch-button control that sets the fine tuning and also adjusts the hue, saturation, contrast, and brightness to preset ranges. These automatic adjustments override the settings of the corresponding separate controls, which then function over narrow ranges only.Don't say what you don't mean.” Choose your words carefully and make them count. Don't belabor these details in your first draft; just get the writing on the page. But when you begin fine-tuning during your revisions, take the time to cut down clunky writing, choose stronger nouns and verbs, and eliminate repetition.Here we will consider four aspects of fine-tuning.

Mating factor activates receptor.
G protein binds GTP and becomes activated.
Phosphorylation cascade activates Fus3, which moves to plasma membrane.
Fus3 phosphorylates formin, activating it.
Formin initiates growth of microfilaments that form the shmoo projections.Fine-Tuning Security Policies Process Overview

EDIT FOR GRAMMAR, PUNCTUATION AND SPELLINGline edit is most effective at fine-tuning an already strong structure. Your line editor might suggest making a few minor changes throughout the manuscript or recommend reworking a few paragraphs here or there, but that's typically as far as it goes.It's as if there are a large number of dials that have to be tuned to within extremely narrow limits for life to be possible in our universe. It is extremely unlikely that this should happen by chance, but much more likely that this should happen, if there is such a person as God.The fine-tuning argument attempts to use data from contemporary physics as evidence for God's existence. In particular, contemporary physics suggests that—in absence of any divine intervention—there was little chance that a unWhy should I write clearly and concisely? In order to succeed in your communication task, you need to keep your audience's attention. Writing clearly and concisely is one way to capture and retain their interest. Rambling on, conversely, may lose your audience's attention.
